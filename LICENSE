PREAMBLE

This license applies to any program in the PHTV distribution that contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this General Public License.

PHTV - Vietnamese Input Method for macOS
Project repository: https://github.com/PhamHungTien/PHTV
OpenKey repository: https://github.com/tuyenvm/OpenKey

================================================================================

This program is based on the original OpenKey engine for Vietnamese text input.
The engine components (Vietnamese.cpp, Engine.cpp, etc.) provide the core
functionality for handling Vietnamese typing with various input methods
(Telex, VNI, Simple Telex) and character encodings (Unicode, TCVN3, VNI).

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

"Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

"To modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier
work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

"A covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a derivative work
under copyright law.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
You are granted the rights as follows:

a) You may run the unmodified Program. You are free to run the Program
for any purpose.

b) You may make and run privately modified versions of the Program.

c) You may distribute copies of the Program as received, in source or binary
form, under the terms of Section 4, provided you also meet all of these
conditions:

i) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it.

ii) The work must carry a notice of the GPL v3 license and this notice.

iii) You must license the entire work under this License.

iv) If the Program normally reads commands interactively, you must make
sure that when it starts in a normal mode of operation, it prints a notice
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty.

d) You may distribute the Program (including any work based on the Program)
under the terms of Section 4.

3. Copyleft.

Each time you distribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
to run, modify and distribute the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

4. Distribution.

You may distribute copies of source code of the Program you receive or
modified versions of the Program under the terms of Sections 3 and 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating it is released under this
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies
the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.

d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
or later of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,
and to convey the resulting work.

e) If you distribute executable or object code versions of the Program
(or works based on them), you must offer to distribute the source code
of the Program.

5. Non-Source Distribution.

You may distribute a non-source version of a work based on the Program
under Sections 4 and 5, provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code
under Sections 4 and 5.

b) Accompany it with a written offer, which is valid for at least three years
and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
corresponding source code for all the software in the object code covered by
this License, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
performing this source distribution, or (2) access to copy the corresponding
source code from a network server at no charge.

6. Patent Grant.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's patent claims, to make, have made, use, offer
to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the contribution.

7. No Warranty.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

8. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY PROVIDE MODIFICATIONS
TO THE PROGRAM BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE PROGRAM.

================================================================================

This project uses and adapts code and concepts from the OpenKey Vietnamese
input method engine developed by Tuyến Võ Minh. PHTV (Phạm Hùng Tiến Vietnamese)
extends this engine with modern macOS integration, SwiftUI interface, and additional
features while maintaining GPL-3.0 compliance.
